# predictive_maintanance
Being a need of hour in the industry where we can reduce the loss and maximize the profit of the firm applying the predictive maintanance models , prediction of downtime, prediction of machine failure, cause of machine failure, time in which machine is liable to fail etc.

A well and carefully designed motor maintenance program, when correctly used, can be summed up as preventive maintenance, predictive maintenance and reactive maintenance. Inspection cycles depend upon the type of motor and the conditions under which it operates.
## preventive motor maintanance
The objective of this kind of maintenance is to prevent problems and make sure that the motor continuously provides a reliable operation Usually, preventive maintenance is a scheduled part of maintaining a whole system.   

## predictive motor maintanance
The objective of this kind of motor maintenance is to ensure that the right kind of maintenance is carried out at the right time. In order to define these two parameters, it is necessary to monitor the motor operation regularly and thereby detect problems before they actually occur.

## Reactive motor maintanance
The main objective of this kind of maintenance is to repair and replace the motor when a failure occurs. Reactive maintenance or breakdown maintenance as it is referred to as well, does not imply any regular service or tests.

This model works on the basis of a dataset attach with this project.
Unsupervised learning is used in this project.
