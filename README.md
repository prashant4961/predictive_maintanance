# predictive_maintanance
Being a need of hour in the industry where we can reduce the loss and maximize the profit of the firm applying the predictive maintanance models , prediction of downtime, prediction of machine failure, cause of machine failure, time in which machine is liable to fail etc.

A well and carefully designed motor maintenance program, when correctly used, can be summed up as preventive maintenance, predictive maintenance and reactive maintenance. Inspection cycles depend upon the type of motor and the conditions under which it operates.

This model works on the basis of a dataset attach with this project.
Unsupervised learning is used in this project.
